As you had to right the technical report, so you had be very careful about technical writing techniques.
1)There would be a cover page with abstract,authors affiliation and the date.
2)you could add table of contents for the ease of a reader.
3)No proper formatting and different fonts and font sizes. 
4)Most importantly scientific language needs to be improved.especially providing hypothesis one should act like a scientist.
5) detailed experimental results have been shown which is good for new comer to understand.
Note: The only main defeciency i could see in this report is construction of hypothesis. There should be clear sense of
      right or wrong when we propose a hypothesis because this fact has been followed the scientists and this is called
      the language of scientists. so we have to follow and try to learn this language that scientists speak in this regard. 
      Overall discritption and shown results are provied with enough details.Report would be prove more effective with the
      above mentioned corrections.
